<!--Process-->
To start off, I decided to create a fake buisness brand as my portfolio assignment to showcase my coding and design skill instead of creating a portfolio of my "skills" as I thought it would be a more beneficial piece for my portfolio in the future. That being said, my inspiration behind this website was my passion for design and graphics. I love creating logos and designing websites by utilizing fonts, color schemes, button styles etc. I additionally enjoy going to coffee shops to design most of my graphic design work thus, I came up with the idea to create The Black Cat Coffee Roasters Website. I wanted to create a website that featured my logo design as well as recent mock-ups I created for this imaginary coffee brand. From there, I utilized stock images from PEXELS which is a free non-copyrighted stock image website to add placeholder images. I began coding my website by structuring the HTML and added Bootstrap as my first framework to stylize the majority of my page. I additionally used a css style sheet to add a few elements but mainly for my aria roles and skip links. Following Bootrstrap, my second framework is Bulma. I mainly used Bulma to add specific icons to my page created by Font Awesome. I faced many challenges during this process however my main issue was with image responsiveness. I found with Bootstrap it was a little confusing on how to make images responsive and it took me a lot of tries to understand the different options such as sm, md, lg etc. In conclusion, I have learnt that Bootstrap is a great styling shortcut. In comparison to the previous assignment, styling my portfolio went a lot smoother and was less time cosuming.
